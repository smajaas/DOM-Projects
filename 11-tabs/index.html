          JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
          JavaScript is the programming language of the Web. JavaScript is easy
          to learn.

                JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan
                Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a
                scripting language for use with the company's flagship web
                browser, Netscape Navigator. Initially known as LiveScript,
                Netscape changed the name to JavaScript so they could position
                it as a companion for the Java language, a product of their
                partner, Sun Microsystems. Apart from some superficial syntactic
                similarities, though, JavaScript is in no way related to the
                Java programming language.

                The JavaScript community of today is arguably the most active
                community in programming. It sometimes seems that every week
                sees releases of new tools, frameworks, and libraries. There are
                preprocessors and transpilers of all sorts available, ranging
                from programs that translate modern JavaScript programs so older
                JavaScript engines can run them, to compiling entirely new
                languages with JavaScript. The JavaScript standard itself is a
                continuously evolving document, with improvements introduced at
                a rapid rate. JavaScript engines incorporate the changes almost
                as rapidly. New operating systems under development (e.g.,
                Google's Fuchsia) are adding support for the development of
                native applications in JavaScript. All of this means that
                JavaScript has an exciting future. It's a great time to learn
                JavaScript!

                Developers can use various JavaScript frameworks for developing
                and building web and mobile apps. JavaScript frameworks are
                collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers
                with pre-written code to use for routine programming features
                and tasks—literally a framework to build websites or web
                applications around. Popular JavaScript front-end frameworks
                include React, React Native, Angular, and Vue. Many companies
                use Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment built on Google
                Chrome’s JavaScript V8 engine. A few famous examples include
                Paypal, LinkedIn, Netflix, and Uber! Beyond websites and apps,
                developers can also use JavaScript to build simple web servers
                and develop the back-end infrastructure using Node.js.
